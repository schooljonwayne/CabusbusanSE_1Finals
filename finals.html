      1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
      <br />
      2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in
      empty squares.
      <br />
      3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or
      diagonally) is the winner.
      <br />
      4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks
      in a row, the game ends in a tie.
